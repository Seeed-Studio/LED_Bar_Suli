Grove LED Bar is comprised of a 10 segment LED gauge bar and an MY9221 LED controlling chip.
It can be used as an indicator for remaining battery life, voltage, water level, music volume or other values that require a gradient display.
There are 10 discrete LEDs in the LED bar graph: one red, one yellow, and eight green bars.
